# BFSI-OCR
The goal of this project is to develop a robust system that uses Optical Character
Recognition (OCR) for efficiently extracting and analyzing data from bank statements, and other documents in
various formats. By leveraging Large Language Models
(LLMs), the system will help in the process of fetching account statements via API, extract
relevant details, even from Images,Pdfs using OCR and perform an in-depth analysis of salaries and expenses through visualization. This project
aims to streamline financial data interpretation, providing valuable insights to banks,
financial institutions, and individuals.
